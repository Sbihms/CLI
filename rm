Removing a single file and then multiple files

Sarahs-MacBook-Air:temp sarah$ ls
boss emma newplace test.txt
cat.txt frog.txt nials test2.txt
dog.txt iamcool.txt temp uncool.txt
Sarahs-MacBook-Air:temp sarah$ rm uncool.txt
Sarahs-MacBook-Air:temp sarah$ ls
boss emma newplace test.txt
cat.txt frog.txt nials test2.txt
dog.txt iamcool.txt temp
Sarahs-MacBook-Air:temp sarah$ rm boss emma iamcool.txt
Sarahs-MacBook-Air:temp sarah$ ls
cat.txt frog.txt nials test.txt
dog.txt newplace temp test2.txt


Removing a file within a directory and then removing the directory.

Sarahs-MacBook-Air:temp sarah$ rm newplace/emma
Sarahs-MacBook-Air:temp sarah$ rm -rf newplace
Sarahs-MacBook-Air:temp sarah$ ls
cat.txt frog.txt something test.txt
dog.txt nials temp test2.txt
Sarahs-MacBook-Air:temp sarah$Â 


Usign the command "rm -rf" not only deletes a file but also deletes everything inside of it. BE CAREFUL when using this command!
