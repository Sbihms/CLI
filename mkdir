Mkdir command lets you make a new folder or directory.

Sarahs-MacBook-Air:~ sarah$ mkdir temp
Sarahs-MacBook-Air:~ sarah$ mkdir temp/stuff
Sarahs-MacBook-Air:~ sarah$ mkdir temp/stuff/things
Sarahs-MacBook-Air:~ sarah$ mkdir -p temp/stuff/things/sarah/emma/joe/cass
Sarahs-MacBook-Air:~ sarah$ pwd
/Users/sarah
Sarahs-MacBook-Air:~ sarah$ cd ~
Sarahs-MacBook-Air:~ sarah$ mkdir temp
mkdir: temp: File exists

My attempt at making about 20 more files. There were some errors. I tried to create more than one file in the same string but it said that path did not exist. I discovered I need to use -p in order to create more than 1 file in a string.

Mkdir -p : will also create all directories leading up to the given directory that does not already exist.


Sarahs-MacBook-Air:~ sarah$ mkdir "Sarah Stuff"
Sarahs-MacBook-Air:~ sarah$ mkdir/"Sarah Stuff"/food
-bash: mkdir/Sarah Stuff/food: No such file or directory
Sarahs-MacBook-Air:~ sarah$ mkdir temp/"Sarah Stuff"/baby
